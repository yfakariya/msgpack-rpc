Release 0.1 - 2011/1/

  Implements MessagePack-RPC 0.2 specs.

  FEATURES
    [Client]
    * Asynchrnous (event-based) call APIs based on Async Socket APIs 
      (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb968780).

    [Server]
    * Event based service invocation (note that asynchrnous invocation such as 
      ASP.NET asynchronous page is not supported yet. So long running operation
      might cause thread pool depletion.)
    * Ad-Hoc reflection based dispatch.
    * Experimental expression-tree based IL based dispatch (cache management
      is not matured yet.)

    [Common]
    * Pluggable filters in serialization/deserialization.
    * Respect error message like :
