MessagePack RPC for CLI Readme

What is it?

  This is MessagePack RPC for CLI (Common Language Infrastructure) 
  implementations such as .NET Framework, Silverlight, Mono (including 
  Moonlight.)
  This libarary depends on MessagePack for CLI.
  This library can be from ALL CLS compliant languages such as C#, F#,
  Visual Basic, Iron Pyhton, Iron Ruby, PowerShell, C++/CLI or so.

How to build

  For .NET Framework
     1.  Install recent Windows SDK (at least, .NET Framework 4 Full Profile and MSBuild is needed.)
         Or install Visual Studio or Visual Studio Express.
     1.1.   If you want to build unit test assemblies, install recent NUnit (2.5.2 or later).
            (Put nunit.core.dll and nunit.framework.dll in /msgpack/cli/lib directory.)
     2.  Get MessagePack for CLI repository as sibling of RPC repository like:
           /some/path/msgpack/cli/MsgPack.csproj
           /some/path/msgpack-rpc/cli/MsgPack.sln
     2.  Run:
           msbuild MsgPack.sln
         Or open MsgPack.sln in your IDE and run build command in it.
     2.1.   You must specify NUnit assemblies to build unit test assemblies.

  For Mono
     T.B.D. (xbuild and Mono Develop might help you...)
